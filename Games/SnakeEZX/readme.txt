It is released under GPL license so you are allowed and encouraged to modify and distrubute it, always with it's source code.

 What's new
---------------

- Now there is a main menu

- Multilanguage. You can choose beetwen english and spanish.

- Improved movement through stick. Now there are no death zones, thanks to MKL.

- Now you can move also with A,B,X and Y buttons instead of the stick.


 How to play
--------------

You are a hungry snake and you have to eat as much fruit as you can. When you eat all the food in the screen you will advance to the next level.

Be careful, don't collide with the walls or with your own tail, or you will get damaged.

You can change the direction of the snake with the stick, but it will never stop moving.

Each 50 points you will get an extra life.
