Scalar

Instalation instructions

To run the game in fullscreen run it with: scalar -f


If you downloaded the Windows binary (zip file),
just unpack to some directory and run scalar executable.

If you downloaded the Linux binary (tar.gz file), unpack to some
directory and run ./scalar.
You may have to check which version on SDL library you have and,
if the game doesn't work, download the latest version.
This version of Scalar is compiled against SDL version 1.2.5.

If you downloaded the source code, you must have the development versions of
the following libraries installed:
SDL
SDL_image
SDL_mixer (optional)

If you don't, you can get it at:
http://www.libsdl.org

When ready, unpack the source to any folder, and run:
make

It uses sdl-config for configuration options, so you shouldn't have any
problems. This makefile uses g++ on GNU/Linux and Cygwin.

File makefile.b32 is makefile for Borland's Free C++ Compiler (BCC). Follow the
instructions on www.libsdl.org website to create development environment
for BCC, edit the makefile to fit your paths and run:
make -f makefile.b32

Other compilers aren't supported, but feel free to try: just compile all
.cpp files and link. If your system is supported by SDL library,
it should work. So far it is known to also work on FreeBSD and OpenBSD.
