The goal of the game is to assemble the picture from pieces.
Each picture is divided into pieces which are shuffled. You need to get each
piece back to its original position. You accomplish that by swapping pieces
(exchanging their positions). You have a limited number of
swappings for each picture.

When you complete the picture, you advance to the next level.
If you have a hard time playing this, you can look at the images directory
and see what the final picture looks like.

Feel free to add more pictures to images directory and play with them
(images can be in .jpg, .gif, .png, .bmp, any many other formats).

Have fun ;)
