Story
-----
  You--archeologist has fallen into the "catacombs of the zombies."  
  There's no time for research, though;
  the walls are closing in, and the zombies have sprung to life!

  Fortunately, you've discovered an ancient mystical potion which
  allows you to create and destroy walls.  Bottles of this potion are
  strewn about the catacombs.  Grab them, and you can break through walls
  when you get stuck, or create a wall behind you, if you're being chased.

  The longer you survive, the faster you have to move.
