May 22, 2002 - July 4, 2007

Requirements:
-------------
  libSDL
    http://www.libsdl.org/
    
  SDL_Mixer
    http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/

  SDL_Image
    http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/


  Note: To compile Entombed from source, if you installed the aforementioned
  libraries from a package (e.g., "SDL_image-1.2.4-1.i386.rpm"), you'll need
  the corresponding development packages, as well!
  (e.g., "SDL_image-devel-1.2.4-1.i386.rpm")


Compile:
--------
  Simply run:

    $ make

  at a shell prompt.


  To build the 320x240 version (versus 640x480), run:

    $ make halfsize



Install:
--------
  Simply run (as root superuser, to install in the default system-wide
  location:

    # make install

  or:

    # make install_halfsize

  This will place the "entombed" binary in /usr/local/bin/, and
  the data files used by Entombed! in /usr/share/entombed/

  Now you're ready to run Entombed!  Just type:

    $ entombed &

  at a shell prompt!


Compile-time options:
---------------------
  Some options may be set during compliation.  See "Makefile" for the
  various variables you can change.
  
  You can also compile Entombed! with sound support completely disabled
  by building the "nosound" target:
  
    $ make nosound

  This removes the requirement that the "SDL_Mixer" library be installed
  and available.  (This can be useful if you have an old PC you want to
  play on, but it doesn't have a sound card.)
